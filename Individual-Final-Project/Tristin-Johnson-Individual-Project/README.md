# Tristin Johnson's Contribution to the GLUE Benchmark

Here is all of the work that I accomplished while workong on the GLUE datasets. Specifically, I worked on four of the GLUE tasks: SST, CoLA, WNLI and RTE. You can find all of the work for each of these tasks in the Code directory. 

The other directory contains an individual project report, outlining all of the details that I implemented in the above 4 GLUE tasks.
